A home for my writing and photography.

I'm building out a container to pair my writing with photos from related events. 
Each photo will be paired with a subset of a writing piece at random. This will make viewing the whole photoset, or reading the full piece a bit of a journey. 

The space is being built as iteratively as I can. I'm not setting out to build a perfect system from the start, but only redesign and rethink when needed. I'm experimenting and new, stable features are being prioritized over pretty code and good design.
