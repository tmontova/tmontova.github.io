***The world's worst living autobiography***

A home for my writing and photography.

I'm building out a container to pair my writing with photos from related events. 
Each photo will be paired with a subset of a writing piece at random. This will make viewing the whole photoset, or reading the full piece a bit of a journey. 

The space is being built as iteratively as I can. I'm not setting out to build a perfect system from the start, but only redesign and rethink when needed. I'm experimenting and new, stable features are being prioritized over pretty code and good design.

Adding a basic feature to site. I have a whole ~dynamic~ thing waiting in the wings but I want to launch something small so that is canned for the moment.

I'm trying to use GitHub hosting, but I don't think it likes how big my images are. They don't render at all, maybe one of them does occasionally. I'm working on adding a Node server runtime and MongoDB (which will definitely end using GitHub hosting, as it can only handle static pages) but in the mean time I might re-upload image array in a lower quality.

Also I have a whole bunch of dumb JS effects I built to try and relearn how to jQuery. Those are real dumb. Ignore them.
